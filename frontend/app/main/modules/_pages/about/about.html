        <p><em>Post taken from the riot games developer forums</em></p>
        <p>Hello,</p>
        <p>For my submission, i created the alpha release of Lolcomp.net! It is a <strong>community research project</strong> that focuses on the interactions or relations between skills. In its core algorithm, it reads the description of each skill, for each champion and determines which tags are applicable according to a set of community defined <strong>Tag Rules</strong>. Another set of rules define the <strong>Relations</strong> between tags.</p>
        <p>While the production of this report happens in the store "backroom", which I call the Lolcomp Lab, the "storefront" (Lolcomp.net) holds a UI that allows the public to explore its findings.</p>
        <p>During the alpha release I will be hard at work creating an initial set of rules until I deem the storefront <em>useful</em>. Yes, right now the tool is useless because I only have one tag rule that defines a Knockup and one relation rule that defines synergy between any Knockup and Yasuo's R. However I will add more and more such as a counter relation between Knockup and Kat Ult, maybe even generalize to Interrupt and Channel, etc etc. Once I am satisfied with an initial set of rules, tweak the core algorithm, and develop some more features for the storefront, I will announce the beta release where registered users can vote rules up or down and nominate exceptions. Users will be awarded contribution points where the top contributors will be posted in a Hall of Fame.</p>
        <p>Please visit <a href="www.lolcomp.net">www.Lolcomp.net</a> and try entering Janna with Yasuo on the same team. Then click on synergy. Try adding any other champ with a Knockup, it may not be 100% accurate right now, <em>(or even 60%  lol)</em>, but check back in a month!</p> 

        <p>The Riot Games API Challenge has ended, but the <strong>Lolcomp Research Project</strong> has just begun!</p>
